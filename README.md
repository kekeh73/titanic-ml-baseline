# Titanic ML Baseline

## Project Objective
This project builds a baseline machine learning pipeline to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggle Titanic Competition.
It includes passenger demographics and ticket information.

## This Week Plan (Feb 23 – Mar 1)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Baseline model (Logistic Regression)
- Tree-based model (Random Forest)
- Project documentation

## Prediction Task
Binary classification:
Predict whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Current Status
Day 1 completed: project structure initialized.
